# Cafe-Management-System
For College Project

The Cafe Management System is a web-based application that allows cafe owners to manage their business operations, such as menu management, customer orders, 
and inventory management. The system is designed to be efficient, user-friendly, and easy to use. The system is built using Springboot (Java) for the back-end, 
Angular for the front-end, and MongoDB for the database.

The back-end of the system is developed using Springboot, which provides a robust and reliable framework for building enterprise-level applications. 
Springboot provides a range of features that simplify the development process, such as auto-configuration, embedded servers, and dependency injection.

The front-end of the system is developed using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. 
Angular provides a range of tools and features for building responsive and interactive user interfaces, such as data binding, directives, and components.

The database of the system is developed using MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility. 
MongoDB is a document-based database that stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easy to store and retrieve data.

The Cafe Management System allows cafe owners to perform a range of tasks, including menu management, order management, and inventory management. 
Cafe owners can use the system to create and manage their menus, add and remove menu items, and update prices. 
The system also allows cafe owners to manage customer orders, including order tracking and payment processing. 
Additionally, the system provides inventory management features, including stock tracking, supplier management, and purchase order management.

Overall, the Cafe Management System provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for cafe owners to manage their business operations. 
By using Springboot, Angular, and MongoDB, the system is built using modern and scalable technologies that can be easily maintained and extended in the future.
